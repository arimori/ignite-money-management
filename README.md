As part of a class from Ignite (*an acceleration program for devs, focused on preparing complete professionals for the market, training technical and behavioral skills in an intensive and practical way*) developed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), this project has been built using **React Context API** in order to manage global state and methods, handling with deposits and withdraws methods.
Also, it was the first time I worked with **MirageJS** so as to be able to consume a Fake API to store data.

The UI was built by Rocketseat Team and I'm willing to improve it by adding some breakpoints to make it able to work on mobile screens.
